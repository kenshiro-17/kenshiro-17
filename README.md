# Hey, I'm Rahul

I'm a developer who likes building things that solve real problems. Currently exploring AI/ML and desktop app development.

## What I'm working on

**[Aether-AI](https://github.com/kenshiro-17/Aether-AI)** - A local-first AI assistant that runs entirely on your own hardware. Built with Python/FastAPI backend, React/Electron frontend, and llama.cpp for inference. Privacy-focused, no cloud dependencies.

**[Sentiment Dashboard](https://github.com/kenshiro-17/sentiment-dashboard)** - Real-time social media sentiment analysis using DistilBERT + VADER with a Streamlit dashboard. Async data pipeline, word clouds, trend detection.

**[JobTracker](https://github.com/kenshiro-17/JobTrackerWinUI)** - Windows app to track job applications with automatic Gmail sync. WinUI 3 + .NET 8, syncs with Gmail API to detect application emails.
